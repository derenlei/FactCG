Congressman Sean Casten said: \"We were rescued by armed officers who did not know the protesters' intent; they knew only that members of Congress were inside, could not leave and that protesters would not let police through.\" The demonstration was organised by three advocacy groups, and included members of IfNotNow, a group that urges US Jewish groups to end their support of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians; Jewish Voice for Peace, a group that advocates for Palestinian independence; and the Democratic Socialists of America. Jewish Voice for Peace wrote on social media that the protesters had gathered to lay out candles for Palestinians killed during Israel's bombardment and to call for a ceasefire. Last week, a large number of House Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in voting to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, over her criticism of the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians. Public demonstrations - both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel - have rippled around the world since October 7, when Hamas launched an attack in Israel that killed 1,200 people, and Israel began a non-stop bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 11,300 Palestinians, about 40 percent of them children. Many thousands of protesters gathered, holding placards with words like: \"Let Israel finish the job\", \"From the river to the sea, Israel is all you'll see\", and calling for \"no ceasefire\" to take place.", "text_b": ["Pro-Israeli protesters with placards calling for \"no ceasefire\" gathered on the National Mall amidst tensions."], "text_c": [], "orig_label": 0}

One of the landmark battles between the European Commission and big tech, it dates back to 2016 when the EU's executive arm accused Ireland of allowing Apple to escape billions of euros in taxes. The EU's executive arm claimed that between 2003 and 2014, Apple parked untaxed revenue earned in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India in Ireland, which is the European hub for big tech. Brussels alleged that this amounted to illegal \"state aid\" from Ireland to firms it was trying to attract. Apple has pushed back against claims the company has sought to avoid paying taxes that it owes, while Ireland has always rejected claims of giving Apple a hidden subsidy. The bloc's highest court heard the commission's appeal this year against a 2020 decision by the EU's lower General Court to annul its order that Apple repay the money. Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella said on Thursday that the 2020 decision was peppered with legal errors and recommended that it was \"set aside\" for a new ruling. The opinion is not binding on the court, but it will be influential and taken as a sign of the direction the case is taking.", "text_b": ["The European Commission's battle with big tech intensifies as it challenges Ireland's tax arrangements with Apple in a high-stakes legal dispute."], "text_c": [], "orig_label": 1}
{"task": "bin_grounding", "text_a": "Text size\nThe European Court of Justice's top legal advisor recommended Thursday scrapping a previous Apple victory against Brussels in a 13-billion-euro ($14-billion) tax case, a blow to the iPhone-maker in a long-running legal saga. One of the landmark battles between a regulatory body and big tech, it dates back to 2016 when accusations were made of allowing Apple to escape billions of euros in taxes. The claim was that between 2003 and 2014, Apple parked untaxed revenue earned in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India in a location which is a hub for big tech. Allegations were made that this amounted to illegal \"state aid\" to firms it was trying to attract. Apple has pushed back against claims the company has sought to avoid paying taxes that it owes, while a certain country has always rejected claims of giving Apple a hidden subsidy. The bloc's highest court heard the appeal this year against a 2020 decision by the EU's lower General Court to annul its order that Apple repay the money.

The company's cash hoard rose to $157.2 billion, up from $147.4 in the second quarter of this year. Buffett earlier this year brushed off Fitch Ratings' downgrade of US credit from the top AAA grade to AA+, telling CNBC on August 3 that Berkshire bought $10 billion worth of US Treasuries that week after doing the same a week prior. \"The only question for next Monday is whether we will buy $10 billion in 3-month or 6-month [Treasury notes],\" Buffett said at the time. Treasury yields topped levels not seen in over a decade in October, before retreating last week after the Federal Reserve held rates steady for a second consecutive time. US stocks have rallied this year on artificial intelligence hype and hopes that the Fed will soon stop hiking interest rates, helping Berkshire's turnaround from last year's rout when the market nosedived.

{"task": "bin_grounding", "text_a": "(Reuters) - Surgeons in New York have performed the first-ever whole-eye transplant in a human, they announced on Thursday, an accomplishment being hailed as a breakthrough even though the patient has not regained sight. In the six months since the surgery, performed during a partial face transplant, the grafted eye has shown important signs of health, including well-functioning blood vessels and a promising-looking retina, according to the surgical team at NYU Langone Health. \"The mere fact that we transplanted an eye is a huge step forward, something that for centuries has been thought about, but it's never been performed,\" said Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, who led the team. Until now, doctors have only been able to transplant the cornea, the clear front layer of the eye.

{"task": "bin_grounding", "text_a": "Scientists announced Monday that it was not the asteroid impact that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, but debris ejected played a critical role. The statement comes from a team led by the Royal Observatory of Belgium, which determined dust from pulverized rock was thrown into Earth's atmosphere, blocking the sun and hindering the photosynthesis of plants. New modeling showed that the amount of dust was about 2,000 gigatonnes - exceeding 11 times the weight of Mt. Everest - and lingered in the atmosphere for up to 15 years, causing a worldwide nuclear winter. Consequently, vegetation would have died off, resulting in the starvation of many herbivorous species, including some dinosaurs - kicking off the catastrophic mass extinction event that saw 75 percent of living creatures disappear from Earth.

But one interesting thing about 55 Cancri e, aside from it being made of diamonds, is the mysterious signal that it has been emitting for decades and which scientists have been unable to find an explanation for. That is, it would seem, until now. One theory which has been out forward is that the planet is continually shedding and regrowing its atmosphere. The atmosphere is 'regrown' when volcanoes open up and spew hot gases over the surface of the planet which then form a new atmosphere. But then the high temperatures caused by the planet's extremely close orbit will cause the atmosphere to be burnt off, leaving the planet once again 'bald' to space.", "text_b": ["The planet's extremely close orbit leads to high temperatures that burn off its atmosphere, which is periodically replenished by volcanoes emitting hot gases."], "text_c": [], "orig_label": 1}
